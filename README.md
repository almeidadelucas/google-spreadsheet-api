# google-spreadsheet-api
POC of google spreadsheet api v4.

## Run the project
To run the project you need to create a new Cloud Platform project and enable the Google Sheets API. You can do that following the step 1 [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/java).

After that, you are able to download the credentials.json file. Copy this file and paste in the folder *resources*.

Now, you need to create a new spreadsheet and share with anyone, chose the option "anyone with this link can edit".
